# What is Lella ?  🦑🦑🦑

A language learning app to learn languages ​​like English German French Spanish. Read and listen to interesting texts, learn the meanings of words you don't know and save them. Afterwards, test your understanding by solving a quiz about the text. Repeat the words you saved and see your progress with statistics.
Growing day by day with hundreds of active users from all over the world (America, Europe, Middle East, Asia...), it continues to develop with my mission of making the application more user-friendly with regular updates and teaching languages ​​to people all over the world.
